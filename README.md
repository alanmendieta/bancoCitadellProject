# Banco Citadell Project 

aBordo, a website built in HTML5 and CSS focused on tourism, domestic and international travel, and information about tourist destinations.

It's my first website built thanks to the knowledge provided by CoderHouse. This site represents my first steps in front-end web development.

Within it, you will be able to access real destinations, tour packages, and international trips provided by well-known websites such as "AlMundo," "Despegar," among others.
